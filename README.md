### Project Overview
<p align="justify"> Crime is one of the complex social problems that has grown a lot over time with the increase in population. Security agencies need to understand the aspects that lead to an increase in criminal activities.The officials as they focus on many issues may not predict the crimes to happen in the future. The officials/police officers although they try to reduce the crime rate may not reduce it in a full-fledged manner. Crime prediction is one of the core activities of criminology that deals with the prediction of a crime incident, identifying crime patterns and their links with other terrifying incidents and criminal groups. Criminal identification and Crime prediction are the major problems for law enforcement agencies. Because of the enormous amount of data, complexity, and increasing crime rate, it is almost impossible for security authorities to manually study and unfold the hidden crime patterns. To overcome this problem, advanced technology is required which can predict the crime and identify the crime patterns with high accuracy. </p>

### Project Objectives
<p align="justify">The objective of this work is to predict crimes at a specific location in the city based on previous crime data. The machine learning models will be trained to predict the crime areas on the given day and time. The training of the model will be done using the Chicago Crime dataset. The dataset will be divided into two parts training and testing using K- Cross fold validation method. The K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), logistic regression, and Naive Bayes algorithms will be for comparison and deep learning algorithms will be used for crime prediction. This work will help law enforcement agencies to predict and detect crimes in a specific area. Our proposed model will help to control the crime rate in the city. We will also integrate it with a web portal so that it will be easy for authorities to use. On the web portal,  the results will be visualized by using graphs and charts such as line charts, bar graphs, etc. This graphical representation of the result will help law enforcement agencies in better understanding crime datasets, crime hotspot areas, crime type, and crime patterns. </p>
