### Project Overview
<p align="justify"> Crime is one of the complex social problems that has grown a lot over time with the increase in population. Security agencies need to understand the aspects that lead to an increase in criminal activities.The officials as they focus on many issues may not predict the crimes to happen in the future. The officials/police officers although they try to reduce the crime rate may not reduce it in a full-fledged manner. Crime prediction is one of the core activities of criminology that deals with the prediction of a crime incident, identifying crime patterns and their links with other terrifying incidents and criminal groups. Criminal identification and Crime prediction are the major problems for law enforcement agencies. Because of the enormous amount of data, complexity, and increasing crime rate, it is almost impossible for security authorities to manually study and unfold the hidden crime patterns. To overcome this problem, advanced technology is required which can predict the crime and identify the crime patterns with high accuracy. </p>
